# Java Subset (Joos) Compiler
A compiler for a subset of the Java 1.3 language. This project was a group project for a university course.

## Authors and Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Edward Xu, Angel Zhang, and Vedant Gupta for many hours spent completing this project together.

## Description
The specification of the compiler has been outlined in a supported features list and assignments for the course. The compiler is created for quite a large subset, so the webpages are linked instead of copying the descriptions over.

# High Level Overview
As of now, I have not yet implemented a way to demo it or reproduce it locally due to specific school configuration, builds, and tooling versions. Until I figure it out, if you want to learn more, I talk about the components of the compiler here.

## Lexer

## Parser

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Type Linker

## Hierarchy Checker

## Name Disambiguation

## Type Checker

## Control Flow Graph (CFG) Builder

## Dataflow Analysis

## Typed Intermediate Representation (TIR)

## AST to TIR Conversion

## IR Lowering to Canonical IR Conversion

## Canonical IR to Tiled Assembly Conversion

## Register Allocation

## Code Generation

## Dispatch Vector (Support for OOP)
